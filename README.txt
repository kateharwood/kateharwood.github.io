My Portfolio

1. 
Implemented Correctly: HTML and CSS pages passed validator tests, all styling is done in CSS files, images are not absolute URLs

Not Implemented Correctly: The website design is not very responsive, and it looks terrible on mobile screens.

2. I went to Yotam Bentov for help with aspects of this project.

3. I've worked on this project for approximately 13 hours.
