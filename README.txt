My Portfolio

1. 
Implemented Correctly: HTML and CSS pages passed validator tests, all styling is done in CSS files, images are not absolute URLs

Not Implemented Correctly: I think I could have done a bit more work with streamlining the classes - there is some unecessarily repeated code. (A big problem is the responsive design for the page, and the fixed positions of my blocks...)

2. I went to Yotam Bentov for help with aspects of this project.

3. I've worked on this project for approximately 9 hours.
